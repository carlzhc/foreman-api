# foreman-api

A Clojure library designed to be used in foreman client to interact with foreman
API.

## Usage

### Create/Update the api library file
- Set environment variables:
  - foreman_host: foreman server url, eg: "https://localhost"
  - foreman_auth: foreman login credential, eg: "admin:MySecretPassword"
  - foreman_insecure: whether to trust unsafe https connection, can be "yes" "no" "true" or "false"

- Generate api definition file (written to src/foreman_api/api_defs.clj):

      lein run src/foreman_api/api_defs.clj

  This will create the api defination file, and will be loaded by `api.clj`.

- Create an update jar file

    lein uberjar

  [[https://clojars.org/carlzhc/foreman-api][https://img.shields.io/clojars/v/carlzhc/foreman-api.svg]]

- In your clojure source files, add:

      (require '[foreman-api :as api])
